  \section{Research Interests}
  
  
  Broadly, my research interests are in solar physics, specifically in the numerical modeling of plasma dynamics in the solar corona. I am interested in using hydrodynamic models to study nanoflare heating in the corona and how these modeled results can be compared to observations from instruments. Additionally, I am interested in using forward modeling to explore how novel machine learning techniques might be used to extract heating properties from active region core emission.
