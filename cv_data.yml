  - title: Graduate Research Assistant
    institution: Rice University
    location: Houston, TX USA
    dates: 2013--present
    advisor: Stephen Bradshaw, Ph.D.
    description: Research assistant in space physics division of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rice University. Research duties concentrated in computational solar physics. Teaching duties include, but are not limited to, a minimum of four semesters of leading lab sections of introductory physics.
  - title: NSF REU Research Fellow
    institution: CASPER, Baylor University
    location: Waco, TX USA
    dates: June 2012--August 2012
    advisor: Lorin Matthews, Ph.D.
    description: Accepted to National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates program in the Center for Astrophysics, Space Physics, and Engineering Research, Baylor University. Studied the effects of dust grain charging on aggregate size in a protoplanetary disk. Numerical work in extending kinetic model of grain growth to examine effect of disk location on grain charging.
  - title: Summer Undergraduate Research Assistant
    institution: Baylor University
    location: Waco, TX USA
    dates: June 2011--August 2011
    advisor: Lorin Matthews, Ph.D.
    description: Awarded a Summer Undergraduate Research in Physics (SURPh) grant from Department of Physics, Baylor University. Conducted research on anomalies in Saturn's F Ring by improving numerical models that simulate perturbed orbits of charged dust grains in a plasma environment.
- title: Research Interests
  description: Broadly, my research interests are in solar physics, specifically in the numerical modeling of plasma dynamics in the solar corona. I am interested in using hydrodynamic models to study nanoflare heating in the corona and how these modeled results can be compared to observations from instruments. Additionally, I am interested in using forward modeling to explore how novel machine learning techniques might be used to extract heating properties from active region core emission.
